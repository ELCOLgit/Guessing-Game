In a challenging deductive logic game known as "Conundrum Code" your objective is to
determine a concealed three-digit code by interpreting hints provided after each attempt.
As you make your guesses, the game will provide feedback in the form of "Off-target" to
indicate that one of your digits is correct but in the wrong position, "Bullseye" to indicate that
you've got a digit correctly placed, or "Null" if you got a wrong digit. You'll have a total of N
attempts to uncover the secret number.

Generate a 3 digit secret code using the randint function.
